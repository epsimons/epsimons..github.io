## Week 8 Journal Entry
I think every project has added to my knowledge level. I struggled in this course a little, and I could not always get the code to work correctly. I think if I had known which variables were linked to what service on the board sooner, my projects could have been more successful. However, being familiarized with this technology is still helpful. I can with some more training realistically work for places that use embedded systems. These projects have taught me to think a bit more critically than before and I believe that will be more valuable than simply remembering every command to light up a light or read a button. Comments are always a good first step in making your code maintainable, readable and adaptable. Even if you code without indents, or use a terrible naming convention, if the comments describe what is happening, you have a leg up.
